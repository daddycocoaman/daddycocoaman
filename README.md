Sup fam. I'm Leron (aka daddycocoaman). Most of the projects here are random ideas that I come up with and try to implement in concept for potential later use. Nearly all of my projects are written in Python. My interests are primarily in pentesting/red teaming and writing tools to assist in those efforts. I've given talks at conferences on topics such as Python, Azure, and wireless security.

I'm also a nerdcore rapper by the name of Ohm-I. Music is mostly comedy but I've recently been writing a bunch of hacker raps. You can peep the following while you're peeping the repos.
